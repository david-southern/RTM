# RTM

This 'portfolio repo' is intended to give an idea of some of the projects I have worked
on in the past.

Remember the Redbox is an Android app that I developed in 2012.  I got tired of renting a Redbox
movie for $1 and then forgetting to return it, and ending up paying $12 to watch "The Santa Clause 3"!

In order to solve this, I built an app that would automatically log into the user's Redbox account every
day, scrape the HTML of the account status page, to see if the user had any movies rented, and add them
to a list in the app.  The user could configure a "rental threshold", and if any movie had been rented
longer than the threshold, I would pop up a notification message telling the user to return the movies.

The app featured an integration with the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) so that
the user could get nice movie posters graphics from their rental titles.  This also allowed the user to 
manually add a rental with title auto-complete if desired.

The app was released on Android, however I had to take it down a few months later when I got a cease and desist
from Redbox claiming that my use of their name in the title "Remember the Redbox" was not legal.

I've restored a "portfolio version" of the [RTR Website](http://spekisoftware.com/SpekiWebsite/Default.aspx) that includes
my attempt at marketing, along with a few screenshots of the app from the Google Play store submission.  (The Speki Software
mentioned on that website is the company I set up to use for mobil app deployment, and my own consulting work)
