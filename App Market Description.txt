If you're like us, you love Redbox movies because they're cheap!  The only problem is that if you forget to return them, then that $2 rental suddenly turns into a $10 rental.  No fun!

Remember the Redbox! solves this problem by automatically reminding you whenever you have outstanding Redbox rentals.  You can configure how soon you want to be reminded, and what time of day you want the notification to be sent.  If you get a reminder when you aren't ready to deal with it, you can quickly snooze the reminder for later.

The best part is that you don't even have to tell Remember the Redbox! that you have rented a movie.  Simply sign up for a Redbox.com account, associate your credit card with that account, and enter your Redbox.com username and password into Remember the Redbox!

We will automatically check your Redbox.com account every day to see if you have rented any new movies, or returned any currently outstanding rentals.  As long as you use the same credit card that you associated with your Redbox.com account, you will automatically be notified when you have old rentals, with no action on your part!

If you don't have a Redbox.com account, or if you happen to rent a movie with a non-associated credit card, you can still manually tell us that you rented it, and get the automatic notifications for your movies.

The best part is that you don't have to remember to set alarms, or leave yourself notes.  Just set it up, and forget about it!  You won't have to worry about forgetting about your movie rentals ever again!
